# fm

`fm` is a simple non-backtracking fuzzy text matcher useful for matching
multi-line patterns and text. At its most basic the wildcard operator `...`
default) can be used in the following ways:

  * If a line consists solely of `...` it means "match zero or more lines of text".
  * If a line starts with `...`, the search is not anchored to the start of the line.
  * If a line ends with `...`, the search is not anchored to the end of the line.

Note that `...` can appear both at the start and end of a line and if a line
consists of `......` (i.e. starts and ends with the wildcard with nothing
inbetween), it will match exactly one line. If the wildcard operator appears in
any other locations, it is matched literally.  Wildcard matching does not
backtrack, so if a line consists solely of `...` then the next matching line
anchors the remainder of the search.

Lines can also be prefixed with `!!!` to indicate negative matching. This comes
with several caveats:

  * Negative wildcard-only matching `!!!...` is nonsensical and is disallowed.
  * Consecutive negatively matched lines would cause backtracking and are
    disallowed.
  * Name matching (see belows) is allowed in negative lines but new name
    matches on such lines are discarded.

The following examples show `fm` in action using its defaults:

```rust
use fm::FMatcher;

assert!(FMatcher::new("a").unwrap().matches("a").is_ok());
assert!(FMatcher::new(" a ").unwrap().matches("a").is_ok());
assert!(FMatcher::new("a").unwrap().matches("b").is_err());
assert!(FMatcher::new("a\n...\nb").unwrap().matches("a\na\nb").is_ok());
assert!(FMatcher::new("a\n...\nb").unwrap().matches("a\na\nb\nb").is_err());
```

When a match fails, the matcher returns an error indicating the line number at
which the match failed. The error can be formatted for human comprehension
using the provided `Display` implementation.

If you want to use non-default options, you will first need to use `FMBuilder`
before having access to an `FMatcher`. For example, to use "name matching"
(where you specify that the same chunk of text must appear at multiple points
in the text, but without specifying exactly what the chunk must contain) you
can set options as follows:

```rust
use {fm::FMBuilder, regex::Regex};

let ptn_re = Regex::new(r"\$.+?\b").unwrap();
let text_re = Regex::new(r".+?\b").unwrap();
let matcher = FMBuilder::new("$1 $1")
                        .unwrap()
                        .name_matcher(ptn_re, text_re)
                        .build()
                        .unwrap();
assert!(matcher.matches("a a").is_ok());
assert!(matcher.matches("a b").is_err());
```
